"""Create or update the schema when the application (or a command) starts.

* SQLite: tables left by older versions of the port are first brought to the current layout
  (``sqlite_upgrade``), then the Alembic revisions create whatever is missing. Demo accounts and sample data are
  created only when asked for (``NAMIFAX_DEMO_DATA=1`` or ``demo.data = true``), and only in a brand-new SQLite
  database (development and the test suites).
* MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL: the Alembic revisions (``upgrade head``) and only the default fax categories and
  cover pages. No demo accounts are created there: a database that serves real users must not start with a
  well-known password. The first administrator is made with ``namifax createuser``.
